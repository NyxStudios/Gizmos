# How to Contribute
If you want to help us port commands over from NyxStudios/TShock, first open an issue for the command.
This will let everyone know that you are working on that command.

You should create a pull request for every command you port, and only include that command in your
pull request.  This is a one-to-one issue/pull request/command system.  This allows for the maximum amount
of concurrent development.
